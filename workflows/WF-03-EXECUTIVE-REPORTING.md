# WF-03: EXECUTIVE REPORTING & GAP ANALYSIS

## Workflow Purpose
Monthly executive communication that:
1. **Reports value delivered** in business language executives understand
2. **Identifies strategic gaps** when achievements are light
3. **Closes the loop** by feeding insights back to WF-02 planning

**Key Innovation:** When there's nothing significant to report, don't just say "quiet month" - analyze WHY and identify what high-value work isn't happening.

## Workflow Execution

### STEP 1: Compile Monthly Achievements (End of month, 45 min)
**Skill:** SK-COMPILE-EXECUTIVE-REPORT
**Inputs:**
- [ ] 4 weekly digests (business value sections)
- [ ] Monthly roadmap status
- [ ] Major projects/initiatives GIS supported

**Output:** Draft executive report

### STEP 2: Assess Report Substance (15 min)
**Question:** Does this report have 3+ significant strategic contributions?

**IF YES:** Finalize and distribute report  
**IF NO:** Proceed to Step 3 (Gap Analysis)

### STEP 3: Strategic Gap Analysis (30 min)
**Skill:** SK-STRATEGIC-GAP-ANALYSIS
**Analyze:**
- Why was this month light?
- What strategic work isn't happening?
- What resources/support needed?

**Output:** Gap analysis + recommendations

### STEP 4: Feed Back to Planning (15 min)
**Action:** Update WF-02 next month's priorities with gap insights

**Total Time:** 1.5-2 hours monthly

## Success Metrics
- Executive report shared monthly
- Positive exec feedback/engagement
- Gap analysis leads to resource allocation
- Strategic work % increasing
