## Tips for Effective Translation

### DO:
✅ Lead with business outcome, not GIS process  
✅ Quantify impact ($, %, time, people affected)  
✅ Name the risk prevented or opportunity enabled  
✅ Connect to strategic priorities (safety, compliance, revenue)  
✅ Use active voice: "Enabled", "Prevented", "Protected"

### DON'T:
❌ Use GIS jargon (shapefile, geodatabase, spatial query)  
❌ Focus on technical sophistication  
❌ Say "just" or minimize the work  
❌ Leave impact unclear or unquantified  
❌ Use passive voice: "A map was created"

## Quantification Guidelines

### When You Have Data:
- Use actual numbers: "$2.5M", "47 personnel", "18% reduction"
- Be specific: "6-month delay prevented", not "avoided delay"

### When You Don't Have Data:
- Use conservative estimates: "Estimated $XXK", "Approximately XX hours"
- Use ranges: "$50K-$100K exposure", "20-30% improvement"
- Note assumption: "Based on similar projects..."

### Always Avoid:
- Vague claims: "Significant improvement", "Major impact"
- Unverifiable statements: "Prevented unknown future issues"
- Overstating: Every request isn't "critical to operations"
