# Style Guide - User Voice Configuration

## USER PROFILE
- **Role:** GIS Team Leader, Pilbara Ports Authority
- **Audience:** GIS professionals in infrastructure/asset management
- **Goal:** Position as thought leader, drive maturity advancement

---

## CORE VOICE CHARACTERISTICS

### 1. Problem-First
**Definition:** Always lead with the challenge, not the solution.

**Why:** GIS professionals are tired of vendor pitches. They respect people who understand their pain before offering solutions.

**In Practice:**
- Open articles with the specific problem they face
- Make it concrete and immediate
- Show business/operational impact first
- Create urgency without being alarmist
- Only introduce solution after problem is established

**Examples:**
✅ GOOD: "Your GIS team spends 15 hours a week hunting for data."
❌ BAD: "3D spatial data management is an exciting new technology."

✅ GOOD: "By the time you find what you need, the request timeline has blown out."
❌ BAD: "Let me tell you about the benefits of centralized data management."

---

### 2. Punchy and Direct
**Definition:** Short sentences. Active voice. No fluff.

**Why:** LinkedIn readers scan. Busy GIS professionals don't have time for rambling.

**In Practice:**
- Average sentence length: 10-15 words
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice always
- Get to the point immediately
- No throat-clearing or preamble

**Examples:**
✅ GOOD: "This isn't just inefficient. It's expensive."
❌ BAD: "This situation can be seen as not only inefficient, but it also has significant cost implications."

✅ GOOD: "That 15 hours costs your organization $50K annually per analyst."
❌ BAD: "When you consider the fully loaded cost of a GIS analyst's time, this inefficiency could potentially result in approximately $50,000 in annual expenses."

**Sentence Length Test:**
- Count words in each sentence
- If >20 words, split it
- If >15 words, see if you can tighten
- Aim for variety but keep average ≤15

---

### 3. Challenge + Guide
**Definition:** Push readers to think differently while providing clear direction.

**Why:** Thought leadership means challenging the status quo, not just offering tips.

**In Practice:**
- Question assumptions
- Show what's wrong with current approaches
- Provide clear "here's what to do" direction
- Balance critique with constructive guidance
- Don't just comfort—provoke growth

**Examples:**
✅ GOOD: "The question isn't whether to modernize. Organizations that figure this out in 2025 will have a 3-year head start on everyone else."
❌ BAD: "You might want to consider modernizing your spatial data management at some point."

✅ GOOD: "Don't build an enterprise platform yet. Prove the value with small scope before scaling."
❌ BAD: "It's important to carefully assess your readiness before embarking on an enterprise-wide implementation journey."

**Challenge Examples:**
- "This maps directly to URISA's 'Optimized' level—but most teams are stuck at 'Repeatable' because their data management can't support proactive analysis."
- "You're not behind because of budget. You're behind because you're treating 3D data like 2D data."
- "The technology isn't the barrier. Your process is."

**Guide Examples:**
- "Start with an inventory. Document every 3D dataset you have."
- "Pick your most critical infrastructure. Consolidate all related 3D data into a single cloud folder."
- "Run parallel processes for 3 months while people adapt."

---

### 4. Technical → Business Translation
**Definition:** Always connect technical capability to business value.

**Why:** GIS professionals know tech. They need help articulating value to executives.

**In Practice:**
- Lead with business outcome, then explain tech
- Show ROI before features
- Every technical point passes the "so what?" test
- Use concrete examples
- Quantify whenever possible

**Examples:**
✅ GOOD: "Deloitte reports 15% reduction in maintenance costs. That's $300K annually for a mid-sized port."
❌ BAD: "Digital twins provide advanced analytics capabilities using IoT integration."

✅ GOOD: "Instead of scattered files, you get a single source of truth. Your team finds what they need in seconds, not hours."
❌ BAD: "Enterprise 3D spatial data management provides a unified repository with semantic search capabilities."

**Translation Formula:**
1. State business outcome (time saved, cost reduced, decision improved)
2. Give concrete example or scenario
3. Briefly explain the technical enabler (1-2 sentences max)
4. Connect back to business impact

---

## WRITING RULES

### Always Do:
✅ Use "you" and "your" to make it personal
✅ Lead with the problem or challenge
✅ Use active voice (subject performs action)
✅ Keep sentences short (≤15 words average)
✅ Connect tech to business value
✅ Cite specific data (numbers, percentages, $ figures)
✅ Name real organizations in case studies
✅ End with thought-provoking question
✅ Make action steps specific and concrete

### Never Do:
❌ Start with background, history, or definitions
❌ Use passive voice ("it is believed that...")
❌ Write long, flowing paragraphs (>5 sentences)
❌ Use corporate buzzwords without irony
❌ Make claims without sources
❌ Offer vague advice ("assess your needs")
❌ Use emojis
❌ Apologize or hedge excessively
❌ Ask questions in the middle (only at end)

## TONE CALIBRATION

### Confident, Not Arrogant
✅ "This works. Here's the data."
❌ "Obviously, anyone can see this is the only way."

### Helpful, Not Condescending
✅ "You're not behind. Most organizations are at this stage."
❌ "If you haven't figured this out yet, you're really struggling."

### Direct, Not Aggressive
✅ "The technology isn't new. What's changed is accessibility."
❌ "Stop making excuses and modernize already."

### Professional, Not Corporate
✅ "Enterprise 3D data management changes this equation."
❌ "We're excited to share insights around leveraging spatial solutions to synergize operational paradigms."

### Challenging, Not Cynical
✅ "Organizations stuck at 'Repeatable' level struggle because their data management can't support proactive analysis."
❌ "Most GIS teams are hopelessly stuck in reactive mode and will never catch up."

## EXAMPLES OF VOICE IN ACTION

### Opening (Problem-First):
```
Your GIS team spends 15 hours a week hunting for data.

Separate systems for CAD drawings, inspection reports, and asset registers. 
Files scattered across network drives and personal folders. 
Three different formats for the same bridge model. 
By the time you find what you need, the request timeline has blown out.

This isn't just inefficient. It's expensive.
```

### Insight (Challenge + Guide):
```
The technology isn't new. What's changed is accessibility.

Cloud-native platforms, smartphone LiDAR, and AI-powered metadata mean you don't need a specialized team or massive budget. 
Mid-sized utilities and regional ports are implementing this now.

But here's the challenge: You're treating 3D data like 2D data. 
That's why it's chaos.
```

### Action (Direct and Specific):
```
Start with an inventory. 
Document every 3D dataset you have—LiDAR scans, BIM models, drone surveys, reality captures. 
Note format, location, last update date, and who owns it. 
This takes a week and costs nothing.

Then pilot with one asset type.
Pick your most critical infrastructure—maybe your main wharf or processing facility.
```

### Closing (Thought-Provoking):
```
The question isn't whether to modernize your spatial data management. 
Organizations that figure this out in 2025 will have a 3-year head start on everyone else.

Where is your team on this maturity ladder?
```

## VOICE VALIDATION TESTS

### Test 1: Read Aloud
- Does it sound like a real person talking?
- Would you say this in a presentation?
- Is the rhythm natural?

### Test 2: Problem-First Check
- Does opening sentence state a problem or challenge?
- Is solution mentioned before problem is established? (Fix if yes)

### Test 3: Active Voice Scan
- Find all "is/are/was/were" constructions
- Convert to active voice
- Aim for 95%+ active

### Test 4: Sentence Length Count
- Average ≤15 words?
- Any sentences >25 words? (Split them)
- Variety in length? (Not all same)

### Test 5: "So What?" Test
- After each technical point, ask "so what?"
- Is business impact clear?
- Would a non-GIS person get it?

### Test 6: Qualifier Hunt
- Search for: perhaps, maybe, somewhat, kind of, sort of
- Remove all unless absolutely necessary
- Aim for 0 qualifiers

### Test 7: Challenge + Guide Balance
- Does it question assumptions? (At least once)
- Does it provide clear direction? (Action steps specific)
- Balance feels right? (Not all critique, not all tips)
