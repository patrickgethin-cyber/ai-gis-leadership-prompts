## MAPPING GUIDE: GIS + AM MATURITY

### How to Connect GIS and AM Maturity:

**Low Maturity (URISA Ad Hoc + ISO Aware):**
- Fragmented spatial data mirrors fragmented asset data
- Reactive GIS work mirrors reactive maintenance
- No strategic use of either GIS or AM

**Medium Maturity (URISA Defined + ISO Developing):**
- Enterprise GIS platform supports AM data needs
- Spatial data integrated with CMMS/EAM
- Some predictive capability emerging

**High Maturity (URISA Optimized + ISO Advanced):**
- GIS drives strategic AM decisions
- 3D data enables predictive analytics
- Digital twins integrate spatial and asset data
- Continuous innovation in both domains

### Article Usage Example:
```
This capability maps directly to URISA's "Optimized" level and ISO 55000's "Competent" stage. 

Organizations stuck at "Repeatable" (URISA) or "Developing" (ISO) struggle because their data management—including spatial data—can't support the proactive analysis that higher maturity demands.

3D spatial data management is the bridge between reactive and strategic asset management.
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Mixing up framework names
❌ Using wrong maturity level names (e.g., "Basic" when it's "Ad Hoc")
❌ Claiming a framework says something it doesn't
❌ Over-complicating with too many frameworks in one article (pick 1-2)
❌ Using frameworks without explaining what the levels mean
❌ Assuming readers know the frameworks (brief explanation needed)
