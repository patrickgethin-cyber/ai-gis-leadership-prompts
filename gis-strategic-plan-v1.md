# 10. Risks & Mitigation

## Critical Risks

### Platform Transition Risk (VertiGIS)
**Risk:** VertiGIS transition fails or significantly disrupts operations  
**Impact:** High (business continuity)  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Thorough testing before go-live
- Phased rollout approach
- Rollback plan prepared
- Extensive communication and training
- ICT support secured

**Status:** Closely monitored, Q2 2026 completion critical

### Resourcing Constraints
**Risk:** 4-person team unable to deliver on roadmap  
**Impact:** High (delivery delays, burnout)  
**Likelihood:** Medium-High  
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritization framework to manage demand
- Automation to free capacity
- Request system to control intake
- Regular workload monitoring via WF-01
- Stakeholder expectation management

**Status:** Active management, automation helping

### ICT Dependencies
**Risk:** ICT capacity constraints delay platform upgrades or integrations  
**Impact:** Medium-High (blocks initiatives)  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Formal engagement and shared priorities
- Early planning and communication
- Alternative approaches where possible
- Executive escalation path if needed

**Status:** Engagement framework being established

### Stakeholder Adoption
**Risk:** Low adoption of new capabilities (PortMaps, Data Hub, self-service)  
**Impact:** Medium (reduced ROI, continued high demand)  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Training and communication programs
- GIS champions program
- Ease of use focus in design
- Success stories and testimonials
- Regular feedback and iteration

**Status:** Proactive approach planned

## Medium Risks

### Data Quality Legacy Issues
**Risk:** Legacy data quality issues undermine confidence  
**Impact:** Medium (reputation, trust)  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Systematic data improvement (Initiative 1.2)
- Data governance and ownership
- Automated quality monitoring
- Transparent communication about data limitations

### Automation Complexity
**Risk:** Automation initiatives more complex than anticipated  
**Impact:** Medium (time investment, ROI delay)  
**Likelihood:** Low-Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with simple, high-value automations
- Iterative approach
- Leverage existing tools (FME, Claude, etc.)
- Build internal expertise (Elaine)
- Document and share learnings

### Skills Gap
**Risk:** Team lacks skills for emerging technologies (3D, automation, AI)  
**Impact:** Medium (capability gap)  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Targeted training and development
- Learn-by-doing approach
- External expertise when needed
- Knowledge sharing within team
- Industry network engagement
